                <p><span class="bold-text"> Cleaning Brush: </span> Filing your nails can get pretty messy, and having dust on your nails is something we would all like to avoid. In that case, a simple brush can be of great help after you've filed your nails! You don't necessarily need to invest in a specialized brush; make-up brushes work just as well. Make sure that the brush is sufficiently large and has a slightly fluffy texture for effective cleanup.</p>

                <p><span class="bold-text"> Acrylic Nail Clipper: </span> When it's time to shape your acrylic nails, using a regular nail clipper can result in a messy outcome. To achieve a clean and even cut, it's recommended to go for a dedicated acrylic nail clipper. This ensures precision and a smooth finish with just one cut! Typically, you can find this tool included in acrylic nail sets sold on various online stores. However, it's also available for individual purchase.</p>

                <p><span class="bold-text"> GELLEN Cuticle Oil: </span> Once you've completed the nail styling, you might notice the skin around your nails feeling dry or rough. To address this, applying a cuticle oil into your routine is an excellent way to maintain healthy and hydrated skin. The featured brand in the image is GELLEN, which is highly recommended, but any cuticle oil, regardless of the brand, will work. If you prefer not to make a purchase, using Vaseline is also a great alternative to keep your skin moisturized.</p>
